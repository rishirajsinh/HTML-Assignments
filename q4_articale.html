  <h1>History of Computers and the Internet</h1>
  <hr>
  <h2>Early Computers</h2>
  <p>The history of computers began with <b>mechanical devices</b>
    such as the abacus. Later, Charles Babbage proposed the
    <u>Analytical Engine</u>, considered the <strong>first concept
      of a programmable computer</strong>.
  </p>

  <h2>Generations of Computers</h2>
  <p>The <abbr title="Central Processing Unit">CPU</abbr> has
    evolved from vacuum tubes to modern microprocessors.
    The 1st generation used <mark>vacuum tubes</mark>,
    while the 2nd generation relied on <i>transistors</i>.
    By the 4th generation, computers became <em>personal
      and affordable</em>.</p>

  <p>Mathematics in Computing
    A famous equation: E = mc<sup>2</sup>
    Another example: H<sub>2</sub>O represents water.
  </p>

  <h2>Birth of the Internet</h2>
  <p>The <abbr title="World Wide Web">WWW</abbr> was invented by
    Tim Berners-Lee. As he once said:
  <blockquote>
    "The power of the Web is in its universality.

  <h2>Modern Era</h2>
  <p>Today, we use <del>dial-up</del> <ins>broadband</ins> and
    fiber connections. Computers now fit in our
    <small>pockets as smartphones</small>.

  <h2>Computer Example</h2>

  To display text on a webpage, you can use:
  <pre>
